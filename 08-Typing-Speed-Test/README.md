## How to Use

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python "Typing Speed Test.py"
   ```

2. The application will present you with a text to type
3. Type the text as quickly and accurately as possible
4. After completing the text, the application will calculate and display your:
   - Typing speed in words per minute (WPM)
   - Accuracy percentage

## How It Works

The application measures the time it takes for you to type the given text and calculates your typing speed based on the number of words and the time elapsed. It also compares your input with the original text to determine accuracy.
